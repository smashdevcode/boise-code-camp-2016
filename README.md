## Sessions

### [Introduction to TypeScript](https://github.com/smashdevcode/boise-code-camp-2016/tree/master/introduction-to-typescript)

Increasingly, developers are relying upon JavaScript to build rich, dynamic web applications. It's not uncommon for 50% (or more) of the application's code to be written in JavaScript. As the use of JavaScript has increased and the applications have become larger and larger, so to have the challenges of developing and maintaining these applications.

TypeScript, introduced by Microsoft in October 2012, is a strict superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and ES2015/2016 language features such as classes, modules, arrow functions, and more. TypeScript's static typing allows tooling to provide richer support for features such as symbol-based navigation, statement completion, and code refactoring. All of this together helps ease the development of JavaScript applications.

In this session, we'll start with a brief history of TypeScript followed by a series of interactive demos that will show you the basics of the language. We'll also see how popular editors like GitHub's Atom provide support for working with TypeScript.

This session is for developers who are interested in learning about TypeScript.

### [Using TypeScript Decorators with Angular](https://github.com/smashdevcode/boise-code-camp-2016/tree/master/using-typescript-decorators-with-angular)

TypeScript decorators, based on the ES2016 decorator proposal and introduced as part of TypeScript 1.5, provide developers with a way to modify a JavaScript class, property, method, or method parameter using a convenient declarative syntax. We'll start this session by creating our own decorator, to see firsthand how they work. Then, we'll take a look at how decorators are used when creating Angular 2 components. Lastly, we'll see how to use decorators with AngularJS 1 controllers to make them look more syntactically similar to Angular 2 components.

This session is for developers who are using (or interested in using) TypeScript with AngularJS 1 or Angular 2.

### [Developing ASP.NET Core 1.0 Applications](https://github.com/smashdevcode/boise-code-camp-2016/tree/master/developing-aspnet-core-applications)

ASP.NET Core 1.0 (previously known as ASP.NET 5) is a new open-source (github.com/aspnet/home) and cross-platform framework for building modern cloud-based Web applications using .NET. It is being built from the ground up to provide an optimized development framework for apps that are either deployed to the cloud or run on-premises. It consists of modular components with minimal overhead, so you retain flexibility while constructing your solutions. You can develop and run your ASP.NET Core applications cross-platform on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

In this session, we'll set up our development environment, explore the .NET Version Manager (DNVM), Execution Environment (DNX), and Development Utility (DNU) tools, and create a simple application... all from the command line.

This session is for developers who are interested in learning about the next version of ASP.NET which is a major departure from ASP.NET 4.5 and ASP.NET MVC 5.
