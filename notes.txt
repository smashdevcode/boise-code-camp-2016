Update TODO notes
  Make sure that Atom extensions are updated



TypeScript Presentation

  Review latest updates
    Update roadmap slide (some cool features are coming this year)

  Practice demos
    Determine what features to show

  Update slide deck


Decorators Presentation

  Tighten up presentation
    Maybe skip walking through the generated code
    This felt like it slowed the presentation down too much and was a distraction because of it

  Practice demos
    Write up notes for simple Angular 2 demo
      Write the code out in real time???
      Or as close as possible as real time???
      Have code snippets on hand and the completed app for backup


ASP.NET Core Presentation

  Update Baseline image
  	Install Docker???
  		Is this something that I want to show???
  		Probably don't have time to do this (before or during talk)

  Prepare DryRun image so that everything is downloaded and ready to go
    Just in case I don't have an internet connection again

  dotnet CLI ASP.NET samples
    https://github.com/caslan/cli-samples
    Review and see if they work???
    Would this be interesting to show???
