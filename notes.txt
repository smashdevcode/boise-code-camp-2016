TypeScript Presentation

  Presentation (update slides)
    Start by showing main language features
    Show slides
    Show features as time permits
      tsconfig.json
      Union Types & Type Guards
      Template Strings
      let & const
      for..of
      Destructuring
      Computed Properties
      Decorators
      ES6 Modules
      async/await

  Show typings???
    Could use this to add lodash d.ts during my initial demo

  Review latest updates
    Update roadmap slide (some cool features are coming this year)

    2.0
      Readonly properties
      `abstract` properties
      `async`/`await` and generators support for ES5/ES3
      Glob support in `tsconfig.json`

    2.1
      ???

  Practice demos
    Determine what features to show


Decorators Presentation

  Tighten up presentation
    Given general overview
    Then show what decorators look like
      Use decorator library???
    Then build out a simple `log` or `readonly` decorator
    Maybe skip walking through the generated code
      This felt like it slowed the presentation down too much and was a distraction because of it
    Finish up by showing simple Angular 2 app

  Practice demos
    Write up notes for simple Angular 2 demo
      Write the code out in real time???
      Or as close as possible as real time???
      Have code snippets on hand and the completed app for backup


ASP.NET Core Presentation

  dotnet CLI ASP.NET samples
    https://github.com/caslan/cli-samples
    Review and see if they work???
    Would this be interesting to show???

  Update Baseline image
  	Install Docker???
  		Is this something that I want to show???
  		Probably don't have time to do this (before or during talk)

  Prepare DryRun image so that everything is downloaded and ready to go
    Just in case I don't have an internet connection again

  Getting debugging working in VS Code
    https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2016/03/10/experimental-net-core-debugging-in-vs-code/
  	Would be good to show this
    Ha! Doesn't work with dnx... just with the new CLI stuff
