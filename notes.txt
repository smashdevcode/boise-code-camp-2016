Decorators Presentation

  Tighten up presentation
    Given general overview
    Then show what decorators look like
      Use decorator library???
    Then build out a simple `log` or `readonly` decorator
    Maybe skip walking through the generated code
      This felt like it slowed the presentation down too much and was a distraction because of it
    Finish up by showing simple Angular 2 app

  Practice demos
    Write up notes for simple Angular 2 demo
      Write the code out in real time???
      Or as close as possible as real time???
      Have code snippets on hand and the completed app for backup


ASP.NET Core Presentation

    Would this be interesting to show???
