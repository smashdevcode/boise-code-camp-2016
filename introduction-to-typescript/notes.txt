TypeScript Workshop


Intro Slides

Welcome
Thanks for joining us
We're excited that you're here

Safe Zone
Any question is fair game
Including "What is TS?" or "Why do I care?"

We Want You to Use TS
Why? Because we believe you'll be more productive and write better code	

Quick Poll
Who is here to learn more about the language?
Who is here to get help with setting up their environment?

How Will This Work?
For those that are interested in learning more about the language...
	I'll be giving an introduction talk
For those that are interested in getting help with setup...
	Will make an attempt to organize into groups
	Probably grouped by your choice of editor
	Three areas are available...
		Conference Room
		War Room
		SW Corner

If You Still Need Help
Let myself or Ken know before you go
We'll do what we can to help you out
