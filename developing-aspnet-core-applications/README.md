# Developing ASP.NET Core 1.0 Applications

ASP.NET Core 1.0 (previously known as ASP.NET 5) is a new open-source (github.com/aspnet/home) and cross-platform framework for building modern cloud-based Web applications using .NET. It is being built from the ground up to provide an optimized development framework for apps that are either deployed to the cloud or run on-premises. It consists of modular components with minimal overhead, so you retain flexibility while constructing your solutions. You can develop and run your ASP.NET Core applications cross-platform on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

In this session, we'll set up our development environment, explore the .NET Version Manager (DNVM), Execution Environment (DNX), and Development Utility (DNU) tools, and create a simple application... all from the command line.

This session is for developers who are interested in learning about the next version of ASP.NET which is a major departure from ASP.NET 4.5 and ASP.NET MVC 5.
